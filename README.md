## User Experience

- Since we will be using MudBlazor, the application will follow **[Material Design](https://material.io/develop/web)** for the web guidelines.

## Architecture

The application is based on [Blazor Web Assembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor).

- IndexedDB is used as the local database with [Blazor Dexie](https://github.com/simon-kuster/BlazorDexie).

## Reference

These references are presented in a logical order for review from start to finish for gathering a deeper understanding of the code base. There is an assumption that you are already familiar with C# and ASP.NET Core.
